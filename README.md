# Remote Sensing Image Classification
## Overview
Transfer learning applied to train an image classifier for classifying remote sensing data into three classes:
* aircrafts
* ships
* none

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Dataset](#dataset)
- [Running](#running)

## Installation
The program requires the following dependencies (easy to install using pip: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```):
* python 3.5
* pytorch
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Pillow
* CUDA (for using GPU)

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded or used from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRh_2oxTGPfbTt6yLVZQ8R7BQ-672uXY/view?usp=sharing)  
After downloading it can be extracted by:
```
unzip src.zip
```
The structure of extracted folder is shown below:
```bash
src
├── test [121 entries]
│   ├── testing.csv
├── train
│   ├── aircrafts [500 entries]
│   ├── none [500 entries]
│   ├── ships [500 entries]
│   └── training.csv
├── main.py
├── utils_jnb.py
└── utils.py
```
## Running

To train the model, simply run ```python3 main.py```.  
Once trained, you can test the results with ```python3 main.py --test True``` (make sure that you have a saved model file : ```model.pt``` before testing)

Here are some flags which could be useful. For more help and options, use ```python3 main.py -h```:

- --directory <name> : if the current directory is not ```src```.
- --batch <number> : to change the training batch size (default = 32)
- --epochs <number> : to change the number of epochs (default = 25)
- --val <fraction> : to change the fraction of validation set out of total training set (default = 0.1)

(or) Simply run the [jupyter notebook](RS_Image_Classification.ipynb) file in google colab (make sure that the ```src.zip``` file is in right place)
